# ckoehler99/vsftpd

Fork of chrif/docker-vsftpd. Offers some better usage in multiuser virtual environments.

This Docker container implements a vsftpd server, with the following features:

 * Centos 7 base image.
 * vsftpd 3.0
 * Virtual users
 * Passive mode
 * Logging to a file or STDOUT.

### Installation from [Docker registry hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ckoehler99/centos-vsftpd).

You can download the image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull ckoehler99/centos-vsftpd
```

Environment variables
----

* Variable name: `PASV_ADDRESS`
* Default value: Docker host IP.
* Accepted values: Any IPv4 address.
* Description: If you don't specify an IP address to be used in passive mode, the routed IP address of the Docker host will be used. Bear in mind that this could be a local address.

----

* Variable name: `PASV_MIN_PORT`
* Default value: 21100.
* Accepted values: Any valid port number.
* Description: This will be used as the lower bound of the passive mode port range. Remember to publish your ports with `docker -p` parameter.

----

* Variable name: `PASV_MAX_PORT`
* Default value: 21110.
* Accepted values: Any valid port number.
* Description: This will be used as the upper bound of the passive mode port range. It will take longer to start a container with a high number of published ports.

----

* Variable name: LOG_STDOUT
* Default value: Empty string.
* Accepted values: Any string to enable, empty string or not defined to disable.
* Description: Output vsftpd log through STDOUT, so that it can be accessed through the [container logs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/logs/).

Exposed ports and volumes
----

The image exposes ports `20` and `21`. Also, exports two volumes: `/home/vsftpd`, which contains users home directories, and `/var/log/vsftpd`, used to store logs.

When sharing a homes directory between the host and the container (`/home/vsftpd`) the owner user id and group id should be 14 and 80 respectively. This correspond ftp user and ftp group on the container, but may match something else on the host.

----

Multiuser
----

The main enhancement over fauria is the easy of user in supporting multiuser environments. This image loads a local directory which allows you to specify users in a config-file
based approach. Place a file called `users` in a directory of your choosing and execute the following to load
the config into the image:

```
docker run -it -v /tmp/custom_dir:/home/custom_dir \
               -v ~/Code/docker-vsftpd/users:/etc/vsftpd/virtual_users \
               -p 20000:20 -p 21000:21 -p 21100-21110:21100-21110 \
               -e PASV_MIN_PORT=21100 -e PASV_MAX_PORT=21110 -e PASV_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 \
               $1
```

The users file takes the form:

```
ftpuser
my_password
ftpuser2
my_password2
```


SFTP
----

Local users are created with the same credentials as the virtual users. The home directories are mapped to the same directories as the virtual users. Set USE_SFTP to some value to enable the configuration and setup of sftp. If this value is not set, all prior steps will be skipped and the system will default to using virtual users for ftp login.

SFTP can be configured by configuring the appropriate options in the config file supplied in this repo, or a new config file can be mounted docker's `-v` command to overwrite the existing file dynamically.

By default, this implementation restricts chmodding ftp files remotely.
